\begin{abstract}
An abstract is a short description (10-20 lines) of your thesis. Because on-line
search databases typically contain only abstracts, it is vital to write a
complete but concise description of your work to entice potential readers into
obtaining a copy of the full paper.

Although an abstract is brief, it should do almost as much work as the multi-page 
paper that follows it. Each chapter or section is typically a single sentence, 
but there is always room for creativity. In particular, parts may be merged or 
spread among a set of sentences.
